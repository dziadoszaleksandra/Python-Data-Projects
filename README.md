# Data Engineering & Analysis Portfolio 

## Projects

### 1. A/B Testing: Marketing Campaign Optimization (`AB`)
* **Objective:** Evaluating the statistical significance of two distinct marketing strategies (Control vs. Test) to optimize budget allocation.
* **Technical Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scipy (Chi-square test), Seaborn.
* **Key Findings:** Demonstrated that while the Test campaign significantly increased traffic (CTR: 8.09%), the Control campaign remained more effective for high-quality leads and direct sales (Conversion Rate: 9.83%).
* **Business Value:** Provides evidence-based recommendations for balancing reach-focused and sales-focused marketing spend.

### 2. Car Price Prediction & EDA (`Car-Price-Prediction`)
* **Objective:** Analyzing market factors and vehicle conditions to estimate resale values.
* **Technical Stack:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* **Data Engineering:** Implemented advanced preprocessing including IQR-based outlier detection, feature engineering (car age, value per year), and automated missing value imputation.
* **Insight:** Analyzed the negative correlation between mileage and price across top market brands to refine pricing strategies.

### 3. Marketing Performance & KPI Analytics (`marketing-campaign-analysis`)
* **Objective:** End-to-end analysis of marketing performance metrics using real-world datasets.
* **Technical Stack:** Python, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook.
* **Features:** Built an automated pipeline for cleaning currency data, date formatting, and calculating essential KPIs (ROAS, CTR, CPC, ROI).
* **Insight:** Identified high-value customer segments (e.g., "Foodies") to improve targeting efficiency.

### 4. Advertising Analytics Pipeline (`advertising_campaign_analysis`)
* **Objective:** Visualizing the relationship between ad spend and revenue across multiple media channels.
* **Focus:** Reusable data visualization components for business reporting.

## Technical Toolkit
* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Scipy).
* **Data Viz:** Seaborn, Matplotlib (specializing in clear, business-ready charts).
* **Statistics:** Hypothesis testing (A/B testing), Correlation analysis, Regression, IQR analysis.
* **Domain Knowledge:** Performance Marketing KPIs (ROAS, ROI), Customer Segmentation, Data Cleaning.
